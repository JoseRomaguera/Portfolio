        <h2>What is Glimmer Chain?</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Glimmer Chain is a skill-based 2D platformer where you control a robot powered by a hook and chain.
                Jump and use the chain to complete levels.

                The project started in June 2022 and was released on April 9, 2024.
                It was developed using a custom engine that I built from scratch in C++, and the team consisted of three people: an artist, a composer and myself.

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I had the following roles in the development:<br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gameplay programmer.</li>
                <li>Programmer of the entire game engine</li>
                <li>Programmer of the level editor and development tools.</li>
                <li>Team lead: Managing the work of the artist and the composer.</li>
                <li>Game designer.</li>
                <li>Created all the sound effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I'm also the owner and handled all the marketing, although that wasn't part of the development process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Create A Custom Engine?</h2>

        <div class="content">
        <p>
                People often ask me: Why didn't you use an existing game engine?<br>
                Part of it is because I really enjoy it and wanted to have a finished and polished product made from scratch in my Portfolio. I wanted to face all the 
                challenges head-on and learn from them to be better prepared for larger projects in the future.<br><br>
                There are also practical reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Full control over what the user's computer is running and how memory is managed.</li>
                    <li>The tools and engine adapt to the project, rather than the other way around.</li>
                    <li>For a simple game, you don't need many of the features other engines provide.</li>
                    <li>Most of the core features are reusable for other projects.</li>
                    <li>No licensing issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
