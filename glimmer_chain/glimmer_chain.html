        <h2>What is Glimmer Chain?</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Glimmer Chain is a skill-based 2D platformer where you control a robot powered by a hook and chain.
                Jump and use the chain to complete levels.

                The project started in June 2022 and was released on April 9, 2024.
                It was developed using a custom engine that I built from scratch in C++, and the team consisted of three people: an artist, a composer and myself.

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I had the following roles in the development:<br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gameplay programmer.</li>
                <li>Programmer of the entire game engine</li>
                <li>Programmer of the level editor and development tools.</li>
                <li>Team lead: Managing the work of the artist and the composer.</li>
                <li>Game designer.</li>
                <li>Created all the sound effects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I'm also the owner and handled all the marketing, although that wasn't part of the development process.

        <h2 id="why_custom_engine">Why Create A Custom Engine?</h2>

        <div class="content">
        <p>
                People often ask me: Why didn't you use an existing game engine?<br>
                Part of it is because I really enjoy it and wanted to have a finished and polished product made from scratch in my Portfolio. I wanted to face all the 
                challenges head-on and learn from them to be better prepared for larger projects in the future.<br><br>
                There are also practical reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Full control over what the user's computer is running and how memory is managed.</li>
                    <li>The tools and engine adapt to the project, rather than the other way around.</li>
                    <li>For a simple game, you don't need many of the features other engines provide.</li>
                    <li>Most of the core features are reusable for other projects.</li>
                    <li>No licensing issues.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In a physics-based game, where smooth and responsive gameplay relies entirely on physics,
                having full control is crucial. That's why I developed my own physics engine.<br><br>

                To ensure consistency across players, I've implemented a fixed physics frame rate of 120 updates per second.
                Additionally, since the <a href="#ranking">ranking</a> requires a fully deterministic simulation, this approach guarantees reproducible results.<br><br>

                The only dynamic entity in the scene is the player, who has a rectangular collider and a rotation determined by velocity. 
                This necessitated oriented collision detection and resolution, though kinetic energy calculations were not required.<br>

            <h3>Grappling Mechanic</h3>
            
            <p>
                A fully realistic swinging simulation isn't necessary—in fact, it would hinder smooth gameplay.
                Instead, the grappling mechanic is divided into two distinct components: swinging and bending.<br><br>

                <b>Swinging</b>: When the distance between the hook point and the player exceeds the rope length, all forces acting parallel to the rope
                are canceled. To enable movement, a force is applied perpendicular to the rope.<br>

                <b>Bending</b>: This is more complex. Each physics update performs a raycast, and if a collision is detected, the hook point is adjusted
                to the nearest corner. To undo bending, the system tracks the angle and rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
                A threshold mechanism ensures that if the player swings past a certain limit, the hook point resets to the previous position.<br>

                The robot is the only dynamic entity, except for the particles in the ending animation.

        <h2 id="ranking">Global Ranking</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In Glimmer Chain, you can replay your records for every level, but there's also a global
                ranking where players compete for the top positions and can watch each other's runs.<br><br>

                Recording every play as a video would be impractical, so instead, the game stores user input and uses
                 it to reproduce the exact same replay every time. This requires the simulation to be completely deterministic,
                 meaning that <a href="#physics">physics</a> and gameplay mechanics must always behave the same way and run at a fixed update rate.<br><br>

                The game uses SteamAPI to manage the leaderboards, but Steam imposes a 256-byte limit on custom leaderboard entry data. 
                To work around this, I developed a custom compression algorithm that converts an array of user actions into a compact buffer.<br><br>

                This system only fails if the compressed data still exceeds 256 bytes, but this is a rare scenario.
                I find it fascinating how, within such a small space, it's possible to store enough information to 
                perfectly replicate a human's entire playthrough of Glimmer Chain.

        <h2 id="framerate_rendering">Frame Rate Independent Rendering</h2>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                As I explained before, Glimmer Chain's simulation updates at a fixed rate 
                of 120 times per second, while rendering remains frame rate independent.<br><br>

                For lower frame rates, there's not much that can be done—latency naturally increases
                as the frame rate drops. However, for higher frame rates (or when the simulation runs
                in slow motion for debugging purposes, such as in the video), 
                the rendering system uses the latest simulation data and, based on the elapsed time, predicts the player's position.<br><br>

                This technique creates a smoother visual effect, reducing perceived latency and giving players a more responsive experience.<br><br>

                The video illustrates this effect: the player moves smoothly, while the green collider,
                which follows the fixed frame rate, appears to "pop" due to lack of interpolation.

                Glimmer Chain was showcased at IndieDevDay 2024 in Barcelona, where I had the incredible
                opportunity to watch people play live. Seeing their reactions in real time was an amazing
                experience and a huge source of motivation for me.

                A few dedicated Glimmer Chain players engaged in an intense competition for the top spots in the rankings.<br>
