        <h2>What is Soul Breach?</h2>

        <div class = "content">
            <p>
                Soul Breach is a turn-based combat RPG featuring both PvP and PvE.<br>

                The project was initiated in 2022 by CosmicSpell and is still in development.
                It is being developed using Unity and C# on the client-side and Kotlin on the server-side, following the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
