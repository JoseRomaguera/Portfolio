        <h2>Who I am</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I see myself as someone who wants to live a meaningful life, doing what I enjoy while staying close to the people I care about.<br>

                I'm naturally curious and driven. Since I started programming, I've felt the need to understand how computers really work,
                from the ground up. I try to stay away from empty distractions and focus on doing things that feel valuable and fulfilling.<br>

                In the long term, I want to keep learning and working toward more freedom and independence. Since I was 16, I've joked about 
                retiring at 30, but behind that joke, there's a real motivation to take control of my own path.<br>

        <h2>Biography and Education</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I was born in Algemesí, Spain, on April 20, 2001. I completed my secondary education at Colegio Santa Ana
                in 2017 and earned my high school diploma at IES Bernat Guinovart in 2019, where I also started teaching
                myself programming, a passion that quickly became central to my life.<br><br>

                In 2020, I took a gap year to focus on self-learning, dedicating my time to online courses and
                personal projects, just as the global pandemic began.<br>
                During this period, I developed my first 3D game engine in C++, marking a major milestone in my journey as a developer.<br>
                I also joined the Handmade Hero community, which completely revolutionized my approach to problem-solving
                and significantly accelerated my growth as a programmer.<br><br>

                From 2020 to 2022, I completed a Vocational Training program in Multiplatform
                Application Development at IES Consuelo Aranda in Alberic.<br><br>

                In 2022, I started an internship at Cosmic Spell, contributing to the development of Soul Breach,
                and I worked with the team for three years.<br><br>

                Alongside my full-time job, I successfully shipped a complete game built in my own game engine and continue
                working on exciting personal projects to further deepen my knowledge of software development.

        <h2>Programming Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In 2020, while developing Silver Engine, I discovered the Handmade Hero series. This experience led me to move away
                from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adopt a more procedural approach, which allowed me to grow significantly as a programmer.<br>
                My perspective was deeply influenced by developers like Casey Muratori and Jonathan Blow, who have become key references for me.<br><br>
                I focus on fundamental programming principles and strive to write the simplest code possible. 
                I firmly believe that SOLID principles and the "Clean Code" approach advocated by Robert C. Martin have, in many cases, done more harm than good.
                My philosophy is: No OOP, no UML, no garbage collectors, no interpreted languages—just simple, straightforward, reliable, and high-performance software.
                <br><br>
                Although I primarily work with C++, which is known for being object-oriented, I restrict myself to using only functions and data structures. This approach makes memory management and program flow more coherent and explicit.
                <br><br>
                Despite my skepticism about OOP, I have successfully adapted to the development style of 
                <a href="../soul_breach.html">Soul Breach</a>, where we use C# and object-oriented programming.

        <h2>Electronics</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In 2023, I developed an interest in electronics as a hobby and built a remote-controlled car.

            <p>I am currently working on building a drone:</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Since I was 15, I've been passionate about calisthenics. I've always believed it's worth investing time every day to stay
                active and improve physical abilities.<br>
                I was also a member of a calisthenics club called Silver Barzz, a group of friends who traveled across Spain to connect with others who shared our passion for the sport.
