        <h2>Who I am</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                I see myself as a man committed to living a meaningful life. My goal is to pursue what I love while staying close to and caring for my loved ones.
                <br><br>
                I am a naturally curious and ambitious person. From the moment I started programming, I felt a deep need to understand computers from the ground up. I steer away from hedonistic behaviors and strive to ensure that my actions contribute value to society.
                <br><br>
                In the long run, I aim to work and study to achieve greater freedom and independence. Ever since I was 16, I’ve jokingly said that I plan to retire by the age of 30, but beneath the humor lies a strong determination to shape my own path.

        <h2>Programming Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In 2020, while developing Silver Engine, I began to move away from Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adopted a more procedural approach. 
                This shift allowed me to grow significantly as a programmer. My perspective was deeply influenced by developers like Casey Muratori and Jonathan Blow, 
                who have become key references for me.
                <br><br>
                I focus on fundamental programming principles and strive to write the simplest code possible. 
                I firmly believe that SOLID principles and the "Clean Code" approach advocated by Robert C. Martin have, in many cases, done more harm than good.
                My philosophy is: No OOP, no UML, no garbage collectors, no interpreted languages—just simple, straightforward, reliable, and high-performance software.
                <br><br>
                Although I primarily work with C++, which is known for being object-oriented, I restrict myself to using only functions and data structures. This approach makes memory management and program flow more coherent and explicit.
                <br><br>
                Despite my skepticism about OOP, I have successfully adapted to the development style of 
                <a href="../soul_breach.html">Soul Breach</a>, where we use C# and object-oriented programming.

        <h2>Electronics</h2>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                In 2023, I developed an interest in electronics as a hobby and built a remote-controlled car.

            <p>I am currently working on building a drone:</p>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Since I was 15, I've been passionate about calisthenics. I've always believed it's worth investing time every day to stay
                active and improve physical abilities.<br>
                I was also a member of a calisthenics club called Silver Barzz, a group of friends who traveled across Spain to connect with others who shared our passion for the sport.
