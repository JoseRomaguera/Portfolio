        <h2>What is Coding Day?</h2>

        <div class = "content">
            <p>
                In Coding Day, you are a videogame developer whose project is about to be released, but a sinister entity threatens its publication, and you must survive it throughout the night in a dark office building full of mysteries and dangers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project was initiated in 2022 by Dreamlight Games and is still under development.
                It is being created using Unity and C#, following the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
                The team consists of one artist, a designer, and myself as the programmer.
